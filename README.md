# HSI-geom

Run the main script to reproduce the figures in "exploring the high dimensional geometry of HSI features" by Wojciech Czaja, Ilya Kavalerov, and Weilin Li, https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01303

Includes the following features:

1. Calculates the angles and distances between clusters
2. Calculates the compression rate by linear approximation

To obtain the features (since they are too big to be uploaded to Github), email me.
